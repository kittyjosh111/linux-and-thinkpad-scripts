# install

- Move ```powerpm.service``` to /etc/systemd/system/. Enable it. For example: ```sudo systemctl enable --now powerpm```. Check systemctl status for errors.

- If your power management backend automatically sets a profile every time the computer wakes from lock/suspend (system76pm does this), you may also need to move ```powerpm-restart.service``` into /etc/systemd/system. If you need to use it, you'd also need to enable this.

- Move ```powerpm``` to /usr/local/bin. **Open it up in an editor and review the values for ```AC_ON```, ```AC_OFF```, ```TURBO``` as needed.** If later you find out that certain commands from powerpm are not being run properly as root, specify ```USERNAME``` with your usename and comment out the provided value for it. Here are the config options and what they mean:

  - ```ACOFF```: Set this to the script to run when AC is **disconnected** (ie. on battery power). Default is set to powerprofilesctl set power-saver.

  - ```ACON```: Set this to the script to run when AC is **connected** (ie. plugged in). Default is set to powerprofilesctl set performance.

  - ```TURBO```: Set this to 1 if you want the script to automatically turn on turbo boost when AC is connected, and turn off turbo boost when AC is disconnected. Default is set to 0, which disables this functionality.

  - ```TURBO_LOAD```: Set this to 1 if you want the script to automatically turn on ```turbo-load``` when AC is connected, and turn it off when AC is disconnected. **Check the turbo-load folder to learn what it does**. Requires systemd. Default is set to 0, which disabled this functionality.

# background and reasoning

Turns out there's a lot of power management scripts or packages available. Each seem to have their own pros and cons, whether it be from the integration of GNOME with power-profiles-daemon, or the extreme power-saving capabilities of system76-power. However, ootb most of these power management scripts don't seem to change automatically in response to power source changes, and it isn't really convenient to have to open a terminal and enter a command every time I connect and disconnect from an external power source. Simply put, if I am on power, I want maximum performance. If I am not connected to power, I want the most power-saving features activated.

Sounds like one of TLP's options. And yet, I want to be able to manually switch off from power-saver to balanced if I need that extra boost in performance on the go. So while TLP is more advanced and has finer control over disk, processor, graphics, etc, I don't see myself using all of them, and I would still appreciate the ability to manually give more performance on the go, which I don't think TLP can do that easily.

Besides, GNOME refuses to render animations well on any power profile other than the equivalent of power-profiles-daemon's Performance profie. While it would look nice to have functioning animations while I am in power-saver mode, it is also extremely unbearable to watch how choppy these animations end up being. Thus, it would be great to have a script to toggle animations on GNOME in addition to automatic power-profile switching.

# implementation and logic

Udev can monitor for changes in ```power_supply```. Quite useful to tell if we are on battery or connected to external power. Once we have a udev rule in place, we can then use it to trigger another script that writes a file to /tmp/ which carries a value of 0 or 1, representing battery and external power, respectively. This is how ```pmtoggle``` works.

Since we now have a file in /tmp/ that automatically updates in response to power supply changes, we can use other scripts to read for changes in this file and act accordingly. One such implementation is ```powerpm```.

```powerpm``` takes in a command to run when disconnected and connected to external power. Internally, these variables are ```AC_OFF``` and ```AC_ON``` respectively. You can then supply whichever power management backend you want, and I have tested power-profiles-daemon, tuned-adm, and system76-power. Find out the command to trigger you equivalent of power-saver, battery, and performance, then put them into ```AC_OFF``` and ```AC_ON```.

If ```/tmp/pmtoggle``` is 0, that means we are in battery mode, and ```AC_OFF``` is run. On the other hand, ```AC_ON``` is run if ```/tmp/pmtoggle``` is 1.

```powerpm``` can also be configured to toggle turbo boost (tested on intel only). Oftentimes, disabling turbo boost saves power and makes the machine run quieter, making a useful change to do when disconnected from external power. Some scripts already have control over turbo boost, including system76-power.

By default, ```powerpm``` does not alter turbo boost whether you are on battery or connected to external power. By setting the variable ```TURBO``` to a non-zero value in ```powerpm```, you can make it turn boost off on battery power, and turn boost on when connected to external power.

Finally, if ```powerpm``` detects you are running on GNOME, it will attempt to turn off animations if you are on battery power, and re-enable them when connected to external power. This attempts to remove the problem of choppy animations on power-saving modes by just removing them altogether.

# other notes

If you want to manually change power profiles, you can still do so using the command line or a GUI extension such as Guillotine / Command Center on GNOME. ```powerpm``` will not change the power profile automatically until the next time you connect or disconnect from power, so keep in mind that the profile switch only happens on each connect/disconnect from external power, and won't be checked at other times.
