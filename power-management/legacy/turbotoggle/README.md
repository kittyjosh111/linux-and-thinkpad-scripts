3) ```turbo-load```: turbo-load is a script that changes turbo boost status in response to system load. Often, turbo-boost is on by default and causes massive heat generation when not needed. For example, my i7 1260p can idle at 60 degrees when turbo boost is on, but goes down to 50 when boost is off. What if we could automatically turn on/off boost based on how busy the system is? We can check system load by running ```uptime``` and getting the first value. [This](https://docs.rackspace.com/docs/check-the-system-load-on-linux) was a good resource for me about system load. Thus, if we set a certain threshold load (which could be a percentage of the total load = percentage * total CPU count), then we can turn off turbo boost when the load is under the threshold (computer probably idling or doing less intensive tasks), or turn on turbo boost when the load is over the threshold (computer is probably busy and could use the frequency boost of turbo boost). This percentage probably depends on your preference and core count, so try different values out. ```turbo-load``` can run standalone, but works great in conjunction with ```powerpm```.
